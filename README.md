## Completion Time
This project was started and completed in seven days.

## Technologies
C# was used to write reusable object classes for the game elements such as the base weapons, and characters. Due to its simplicity and all the support from the indy game development community, the **Unity Game Engine** was incorporated into the project to compile all the assets and game elements such as animations, classes, action handlers, and backgrounds into a working file. **Unity Collab** , along with Github, worked as version control for the project between the contributors.
